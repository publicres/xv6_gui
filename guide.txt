This is a guide for FileEditor.

You can open a (.txt) file with FileEditor in GUIFileSystem.

In the FileEditor, you can both use your mouse and keyboard to operate.
But try not to use them at the same time if you are executing xv6 at a virtual machine (i.e. QEMU), because the signal keyboard sents to OS will sometimes interrupt the signal of mouse. If this happens, you will see the mouse fly from here to there and click everywhere, congratulations! Luckily, we have found out a solution to recover from the error condition. All you should do is to click the middle button of mouse and not moving it at the same time -- Then the promblem will be fixed automatically.


Usage Guide:

If the TXT are too long for a single screen to show, try to click the Up and Dn button on the right tool bar to scroll the pages.

You can try to key down the LEFT or RIGHT key to move the cursor. Or you can just use mouse to reset the cursor position anywhere in the TXT.

You can enter normal keys to insert letters to the TXT. Or you can enter Backspace or Delete to remove the letters around the cursor.

Try to save your TXT by clicking the Save button on the right. If you haven't saved the modified TXT, the word "Save" will become red.

Click the red button in the top-right corner to close FileEditor. If you forget to save the TXT, don't worry, we will remind you and you can decide what to do further. Try it!!

Enjoy the FileEditor~ Have fun!
